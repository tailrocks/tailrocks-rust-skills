# Maintenance

## Verify commands

Run each command from the repository root. Every command must exit 0.

Structure check:

```sh
alint check
```

Expected result: no errors. The check enforces required paths,
manifest agreement, README sections, skill-id shape, and the ban on
component catalogs.

Strict-JSON check. It rejects comments, trailing commas, and
duplicate keys in the three manifests:

```sh
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json
FILES = ["plugin.json", ".claude-plugin/plugin.json", ".kimi-plugin/plugin.json"]
def hook(pairs):
    seen = set()
    for key, _ in pairs:
        if key in seen:
            raise ValueError("duplicate key: " + key)
        seen.add(key)
    return dict(pairs)
for path in FILES:
    with open(path) as handle:
        json.load(handle, object_pairs_hook=hook)
    print("OK " + path)
EOF
```

Expected result: one `OK` line per manifest.

Frontmatter and ID check. It verifies the frontmatter block, the
name key, name and directory agreement, id charset, and the
description key for each skill:

```sh
python3 - <<'EOF'
import glob, os, re, sys
found = sorted(glob.glob("skills/*/SKILL.md"))
errors = []
for path in found:
    skill_id = path.split(os.sep)[1]
    text = open(path).read()
    match = re.match(r"---\n(.*?)\n---\n", text, re.S)
    if not match:
        errors.append(path + ": missing frontmatter block")
        continue
    front = match.group(1)
    name = re.search(r"^name:\s*(\S+)\s*$", front, re.M)
    if not name:
        errors.append(path + ": missing name key")
        continue
    if name.group(1) != skill_id:
        errors.append(path + ": name does not match directory")
    if not re.fullmatch(r"[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*", name.group(1)):
        errors.append(path + ": invalid skill id")
    if not re.search(r"^description:", front, re.M):
        errors.append(path + ": missing description key")
if errors:
    print("\n".join(errors))
    sys.exit(1)
print("OK %d skills: names match, ids valid, descriptions present"
      % len(found))
EOF
```

Expected result: `OK 15 skills` plus the verified-facts summary.

Markdown check:

```sh
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2@0.23.3 "**/*.md"
```

Expected result: no issues in new and changed files. Pre-existing
findings remain in generated `.github/` files, the `MANIFEST.md`
template placeholders, three status-table rows, and long code-sample
lines. The version is pinned. There is no shared markdownlint config
yet, so the check uses default rules. Do not hand-edit `.github/` to
silence them.

Native validator probes (read-only, no install):

```sh
claude plugin validate ./
muse plugins validate ./ --json
muse skills validate ./skills/tailrocks-rust-review
```

Expected result, observed 2026-10-07: `claude plugin validate`
passes with one author warning (the host manifest carries name,
version, and description only, per the common structure).
`muse plugins validate` reports `valid: true`, finds all 15
skills through the portable root manifest, and lists warnings only:
unrecognized skill frontmatter keys (`when_to_use`,
`disableModelInvocation`). `muse skills validate` reports valid.

Known tension: `claude plugin validate --strict` reports failure
because it promotes the author warning to an error. Plain
validation passes, so the package installs. Do not add `author` to
the host manifest as a local fix: that would break the common
structure. Resolve the tension in the common design instead.

Generation diff. It proves `.github/` matches the generator output.
Run it only where `velnor-actions` is available:

```sh
velnor-actions generate --output-dir /private/tmp/velnor-preview
diff -r .github /private/tmp/velnor-preview
```

Expected result: empty diff. The generator preserves
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. No restore step is necessary.
See the CI source section below.

## Policy version and update

- alint: v0.17.0.
- Shared profile: `standards/alint/active.yml` at
  tailrocks-skills commit
  `d54adec8f3188962cdd2b8298350d24114b87079`.
- Pin:
  `sha256-80c782b168658bbfb10aa01f43712435ef20313f5af22ffaddd6b08256b22616`.
- markdownlint-cli2: 0.23.3.

Bump the pin in one pull request: update the REV and HASH together
in `.alint.yml`, regenerate, and re-run every verify command.

## CI source and regeneration

`.velnor/config.toml` is the source. `velnor-actions generate` writes
`.github/` from it. Never hand-edit `.github/` as the fix for a
workflow problem. Change the config and regenerate.

The 0.1.0 generator (velnor-new commit `47c7b5b2e`) preserves the
hand-placed `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. A regenerate keeps
the file unchanged. Do not restore the file after a regenerate.

The generated CI also compares `.github/` against a fresh generate.
The observed comparison is empty. Keep the template: the shared
alint profile requires it.

## Release and migration

Release in this order:

1. Tag the release commit.
2. Resolve the exact commit SHA of the tag.
3. Bump the `rev` of this plugin in the central catalog at
   `tailrocks/tailrocks-skills`.
4. Regenerate the native catalogs from the central source.
5. Re-run every verify command.
6. Publish the tag.

Migrate installs per the agent procedures in `installation.md`.
Uninstall each plugin per scope, remove the old marketplace, add the
new marketplace, and install the plugin. The order prevents
duplicates.

## Prohibited evaluation content

Never add evaluation content to skills, references, templates, task
definitions, or CI. This ban covers behavioral benchmarks, trigger
precision and recall, repeated model trials, scored wording
comparisons, and model-family matrices. It also covers pressure
scenarios, holdout datasets, judge models, grader models, and
pass-rate targets. It also covers token and latency comparisons,
mandatory failing baselines, and task trials under any name. Do not
relabel such work as smoke, pressure, or compatibility checks. A
sample task never proves behavior.

Before aggregate commands, read each task definition and strip
evaluation steps. Never trust the command name. To find violations,
search case-insensitively for `benchmark`, `trigger precision`,
`trigger recall`, and `model trial`. Also search for `scored
output`, `model-family`, `pressure scenario`, and `holdout`. Also
search for `judge`, `grader`, `pass-rate`, and `task trial`. Read
the surrounding text before a change. A prohibition or a historical
explanation is not an active requirement.
